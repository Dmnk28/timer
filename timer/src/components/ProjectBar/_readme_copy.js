const readme_copy = `# An 25 + 5 Timer
This FCC Project is the last of five projects to get the Front End Development Libraries Certification. Becouse of that and the fact that I actually could use such a kind of timer in my everyday life I invested some more time in styling and design.

## What I learned
1. setInterval can get inaccurate over time :D
1. the accurateInterval package is a brilliant alternative
1. I was a noob in handling time in JS
1. I'm better now, but I will train more
1. Due to different tasks at work and in our houshold I was distracted and forgott to commit changes regulary. I have to get a routine therefore in future. Not commiting over hours causes unnecessary risks!
1. Short Git Commit Titles! Always! If more Text is needed, write a Description
1. the [heikei](https://app.haikei.app/) project has powerful free online desingtools. Backgrounds and so on can be exported as svg or png.

## Design
The Project-Design is similar to the other FCC-Front-end-Libaries-Project. I simply centered the userinterface in the middle of the screen, the ProjectBar can be found on the left side. 

For the first time I decided to try out glassmorphism. Due to its accessibility-disadvantages, I'am not shure to use it in an larger project, but this mini project is a good test area.

Maybe a few 'glass-items' would look nice in a not-glass website. And for mobile apps glassmorphism looks fancy. So it's clearly worth a try.

### The backdrop-filter Problem
In Mozilla Firefox and a few other browsers the \`backdrop-filter\` is not supported. Support can be switched on manually (in Firefox 70 and higher), but I wouldn't expect users not beeing developers to do that.  

## Project-URL:
You can find the project in the wild on my [webpage](https://do-webdev.de/), which might be under construction. 
But the Project is already reachable: [https://do-webdev.de/projects/timer/](https://do-webdev.de/projects/timer/).`;
